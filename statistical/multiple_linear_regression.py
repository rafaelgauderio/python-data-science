# representative (realistic) models require multiple regressions
# y = inferred value, bo = intercept, b1*x = coefficient 8 independent variable
# after 3 dimensions, we do not a visual way to represent the data

# Adjusted R-squared smaller RÂ²
# adjusted r-squared measueres how your model fits the data, but penalizes excessive use of variables
# Adjusted R-squared is the vases for comparing models
# A parameter that increases R-squared but decreases adjusted R-squared holds no predictive power, so can be omitted
